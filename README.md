This is an app for Android that I made, called Let's Play Sports! 

The idea behind the app is to help people find local sports games to play in. Users can create games and sign up for games as a player or a referee.

Sign in is handled by Google, using the Google sign-in API. From here, users can sign out, create a game, or view games they've made or signed up for.


This is where the user can create a game:

Users add the sport, address, city, state, whether it is fun or competitive, and the number of players and referees (in the image 22 and 7, respectively)

Where users search for games:
