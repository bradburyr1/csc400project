This is an app for Android that I made, called Let's Play Sports! 

The idea behind the app is to help people find local sports games to play in. Users can create games and sign up for games as a player or a referee.

This is the home screen. Sign in is handled by Google, using the Google sign-in API. From here, users can sign out, create a game, or view games they've made or signed up for.
